# SAMGPT
Text-to-speech chatbot using the OpenAI ChatGPT API and the sam-js library (a port of C64 SAM to javascript.)  
The goal was to make something capable of giving a retro voice to ChatGPT. (albeit a bit of a silly one)
Usage: Insert your own OpenAI API key into the client-side javascript. (Never host this tool over http, it's designed only for local usage.)
Have fun!
